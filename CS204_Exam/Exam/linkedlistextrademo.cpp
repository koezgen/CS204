/************************************************************************
* This function is to show the effect of using reference and value		*
* parameters for the classes. When you use reference or const-reference	*
* parameter, the argument is not copied to the parameter, thus copy		*
* constructor is not invoked. However if you pass a class parameter by	*
* value, implicitly the copy constructor is invoked. If you use default	*
* or shallow copy constructor, when list is destructed at the end of the*
* function original list is also destructed and this causes a problem.	*
* Thus it is always better to use reference or const-reference			*
* parameters for classes. Using deep copy constructor also solves the	*
* problem of value parameters.											*
*																		*
* Try this function with the different combinations of					*
* value, reference and const-reference parameters, and shallow and		*
* deep copy constructors.												*

	*																		    *

	* crashes or shows an abnormal behavior in debug mode.                      *
	* This is due to trying to delete the memory locations of the list	        *
	* twice (one for list1, one for list2)	by the destructor.		            *
	*																		    *
	* For deep constructor, there are no such problems. Try it with deep	    *
	* copy constructor as well.												    *
