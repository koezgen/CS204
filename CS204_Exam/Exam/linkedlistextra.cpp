* First try the program with this and see the problems.			*
* Then use the deep copy constructor provided below and see		*
* that the problems are resolved.								*
* Moreover, compiler's default copy constructor does the same	*
* job with this shallow copy constructor. Try this by removing	*
* both shallow and deep constructors.							*
* In all cases get in the functions during debug (F7) to see	*
* how they behave. Press F11 at the end of the program to see	*
* how destructor is invoked.									*
