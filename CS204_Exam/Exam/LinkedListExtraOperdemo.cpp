	/* ALSO TRY
	   - change deep copy to shallow copy constructor
	   - change "const LinkedList &" return type of assignment operator to  "LinkedList" return type
	       - this invokes copy constructor at return time and destructor for the value returned at the end of statement
	   with these changes, list3 = list1; assignment causes a copy constructed linked list to be returned (which contains the same nodes of list3 due to shallow copy)
	   and this copy constructed list is destructed after assignment. Thus list3 contains a destructed list.
